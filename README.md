# Top Drawer / Web
Web is our public-facing web storefront.

## Setup
### Vagrant
Web uses [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) to manage the development environement.  Install Vagrant if you haven't already and then run `vagrant up` in the project's root folder.  Vagrant should provision an environment with nvm that you can use to run the app locally.  Once the Vagrant virtual machine is provisioned you can SSH into it using `vagrant ssh`.

## Running locally
TODO(Steve): SSH into your Vagrant virtual machine and run `TBD`.
